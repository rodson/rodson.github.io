I have never thought that I will write my blog because I'm not good at writing and it's one thing I always horrible at. When
I was in the primary school, what frightened me the most was the exam of writing an article with 800 words.
I just read the article topic over and over again with my blank brain. Wondering what the heck should I start
with. However, I finally make a decision to establish a writing habbit.

##Why I start blogging

As a developer, I always need to learn many techniques for building a stuff. Although I can apply them to my 
projects, but when others ask me to explain how this works, I often can't explain clearly. So I think writing
them down is a great way to organize what I have learned and get a better understanding of the knowledge. I can
also review them whenever I want. If my blog's content is good enough, it will be useful for those who want to learn
this same thing.

It's amazing that we can get almost any information or knowledge through the Internet. With the Internet, people from all over the world
are connected with each other. Writing blog is a great way to share knowledge and making us more connected. I enjoy
reading others' blog and often get inspired by their awesome thoughts and amazing ideas. I acquire a lot from their
great article. So, maybe we can help others by sharing our thoughts or knowledges. We can make a difference.

Writing make me think. It force me to summarize what I've done. If we want to write something useful, we must read
more, learn more and think more. Our life will be more meaningful.

##Establish a writting habbit

Since writing can benefit me so much as I mentioned above. I deciside to establish a writting habbit. It's always 
difficult to get started. There is no doubt my blog will suck at the beginning, but I believe practice makes perfect.
There is still a long way for me to go.
